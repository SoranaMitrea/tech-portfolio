# Tech-portfolio

Welcome to my technical portfolio! Here I document my practical projects in *Arduino, Sensor Fusion, and Artificial Intelligence (AI)*.  

 


*Project no.1* : **Automatic control of an air conditioning unit** *(temperature dependent)*
- Temperature and humidity measurement with DHT11 Temperature and Humidity sensor and display on LCD 16x2  
- Air conditioner control using IR LED + 2N2222 transistor
  

*Project no.2* : **Virtual Friction sensor**

Real time estimation of tire-road friction coefficient using a combination of *empirical, classical ML and GenAI* approach
-   Empirical Model - calculates µtruth from real driving data
-   Classical AI Model - uses *sensor fusion* (IMU sensor, OBD2 data, Temp.-Humid.-Press. sensor) to predict friction in real time through supervised ML
-   GenAI Model - analyzes *acoustic patterns* from a microphone to detect surface conditions and refine µ estimation.

  *The combined multi-layer architectures enables predictive and adaptive friction estimation for intelligent vehicle control and energy optimization.*
